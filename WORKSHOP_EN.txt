[*]Hello there! This is the co-designer AustinF91. Yep, I am the one who asked 欧煌鱼 to make this mod; ) So in this team, he did all the coding part and I did mainly the design part. So if you thought this mod was designed badly or you were having an unpleasant time playing this mod, Please, blame me instead. But if you encountered any bug, just ask 欧煌鱼 to fix it for you. Since he is not that good at English, I'll just BS the whole introduction page. 

[*]First of all, I wanna thank 欧煌鱼 for all the hard work. Thanks to his efficiency, the whole mod was made within a month, during which I even made several changes in the original design. He deserves all the praise and love! Let's give him a round of applause!!!![cheers][cheers][cheers]

[*]All the pics in the mod are from the official websites or made by himself. (Wait, I didn't know you made any pics before???)

[*]We would NOT apply any Liella!'s songs to the mod recently. Reason 1: Copyright Issues. Reason 2: How did you guys add BGMs to your mods? The example code from 2k was so fricking annoying. (Says 欧煌鱼）

[*]Start location with high probability adjacent Cocoa Resources.[noparse][Note4][/noparse]
[/list]

[h1]Note[/h1]
[olist]
[*]This might fewer the turns you need to complete the technology than the Technology Tree shows.

[*]This function is made by Lua scripts. There might be some issues when you are playing online since online players' network and computers might be different. But this would not affect the ability to function normally.

[*]"Liella!'s Album" is a newly added Great People. Each Liella!'s Album would grant a great work of music (from Liella!). It provides 4 Culture and 4 Tourism and can only be granted by Liella!'s unique ability or its unique unit: School Idol. But if your opponent is rich enough, he could also buy it. (Seriously, why would anyone spend more than a Millian Belief or Gold on just ONE great work of music?)

[*]But it would not work on all the maps. We assume the reason might be lack of cocoa beans in that map.

[h1]End of all the BS. Anyway, we hope you enjoy this mod. Have fun!![/h1]
